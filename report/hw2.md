## How much time did you spend on this project

* read spec 30min
* write grammars 1hr
* write report 15min

## Project overview

Initially, I defined all tokens using `ALL_CASES`, excluding keywords.  
Subsequently, I adapted the `scanner.l` file to yield tokens following TA's template for hw1.  
Secondly, I constructed grammar rules according to spec, using `snake_case` to represent non-terminals.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

Debug the grammars and find how to implement array type and array reference when tests error.

## Feedback to T.A.s

The spec lacked explicit clarification regarding data types, specifically concerning array types.  
Additionally, there was no indication in the spec that array reference could be expression.

Missing `libbison-dev` package in Dockerfile.  
Missing function only test case.
