## How much time did you spend on this project

5 hours

## Project overview

Define `delimiter`, `operator`, `keyword` in definitions section, and use `LIST_TOKEN` to print token.  
Define `dec_integer` as `0` or `nzdec_integer`, to prevent leading zero when decimal number is not zero.  
Define `float` as `dec_integer` concat `fraction`, `fraction` as `.0` or `nz_fraction`, to prevent redundant `0`s.  
Define `scientific` as `{a}[eE][+-]?{b}`, `{a}` is nonzero integer with optional fraction or zero with nonzero fraction, `{b}` is `dec_integer`.  
Use exclusive start condition to parse string and comment.
Ignore all space and tab.  


## What is the hardest you think in this project

Understand the lexical definitions of `P` language.

## Feedback to T.A.s

Good, but some definitions are hard to understand.  

I believe we should employ SSH for repository cloning instead of relying on personal access tokens.
